# 👋 Hey there, I’m Begisen

I count money for a living 💸 — but my real passion lies in numbers of a different kind.

By night (and weekends), I’m deep in football prediction models, Excel wizardry, and Monte Carlo simulations — all fueled by a not-so-secret goal: winning the jackpot 🧠⚽. I’m currently a Data Science student at Moringa School, learning how to turn data into decisions, insights, and (hopefully) luxury.

### 🧩 What I’m About
- 📊 Building data-driven football prediction systems on Excel & Python
- 🧠 Believer in lifelong learning (data science is like life — it ends at `exit(0)`)
- 🛠️ Passionate about community-driven problem solving
- 🎯 Hoping to fund my dream lifestyle with data science jobs, cool projects & collaborations

### 🔍 Let’s Connect
Do you have a job, a football-based repo, or a data project I can learn from? I’m in.  
Follow me, fork my ideas, or just say hey. I’m certain you’ve got something I can learn from you.
